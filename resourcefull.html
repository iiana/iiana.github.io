            My team of three designers was challenged to create a digital product
            to help the library strengthen its reach. The assignment was vague (again, this was a study project) - we were
            essentially told to just brainstorm on how libraries could attract more visitors in the digital age.

          <p>Through our research, we discovered that users have a lot of

            This dissonance between what users believed and how they acted led
            us to the creation of a browser extension: ResourceFull. The extension helps our users to find
            trustworthy library resources at their convenience, that they may not have known were so accessible.</p>

            So, a library's main purpose is to provide access to information,
            ideas, and knowledge. We thought that search engines and book stores
            fit this concept, so we did a SWOT analysis using Google, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble.
            The competitors' weaknesses are either paid access or lack of curation of materials offered.
          <p><strong>Amazon</strong> - paid access <br><strong>Google</strong> - too much
            information, lack of credibility<br><strong>Barnes & Noble</strong> - paid access, limited to books</p>

          Lots of our key findings felt like things that were out of our reach (making budget changes, for example),
          but Gina's comment stood out to us. It was something we could definitely relate to, and felt
          like a gap that could be bridged. To understand why young professionals aren't utilizing their
          local libraries, we conducted a survey with 108 people (variety of ages), and interviewed 6 (young professionals). We didn't just
          target people who don't use library resources; we also wanted to know what people that
          <strong>were</strong> using their libraries found useful.

        <p><strong>Survey findings</strong></p>
        <ul class="unstyled">
          <li>98% of users use the internet multiple times a day</li>
          <li>66% of users use the library a few times a year or never</li>
          <li>52% of users say the internet replaces the library</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At this point, it looked like people believed the internet can offer most of the information needed,
        along with being more convenient.</p>
        <p><strong>Interview findings</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>There was lack of knowledge about what a library can offer. Interviewees believed that the library is merely
          a place to get a book.</li>
          <li>Going to the library was too inconvenient.</li>
          <li>The resources at the library felt more credible than trusting search results (blog posts, random articles, etc).</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote class="p-4">“I think one of the things that keep me using the library is
          that you can really trust the information that is there. Or  I can compare
          it more objectively to the information I’m getting from other sources”.<br> - Michael

        <p>As a team, we decided to dig deeper into the credibility advantage.
          Additional research helped us to define the following cognitive dissonance:</p>

          <li>66% of millennials interviewed by us prefer using the Internet
            and don’t use library services because they find them inconvenient.

          <p>The internet is a great resource for providing information quickly, but

        <p>At first, we thought that the solution should be mobile (website or app) since most young professionals
          seem to spend a lot of time on their <strong>phone</strong>. But libraries typically have websites already,
          and that wasn't helping to address this problem. And it would be unlikely for someone to download an app
          for a library that they don't already use regularly.</p>
        <p>
          We were trying to attract new visitors to the library. Young professionals already read a ton of blogs, articles, etc in their browser.
          A browser extension would let libarries showcase related resources they have on topics that a user
          is interested in/reading about.
