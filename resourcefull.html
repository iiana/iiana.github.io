          <p>My team of three designers was challenged to create a digital product
            to help the library strengthen its community. The assignment was vague
            which opened a lot of doors for the research. One thing we knew for sure
            is that most public libraries are already adapting to digital standards
            and should not stop.</p>

            “Today we are in the midst of a tremendous shift in the way Americans
            consume literature and other content, but one thing has not changed —

          <p>In the process of our research, we discovered a unique cognitive

        <p>The first obstacle was to find who presents competition to the library.
          We decided to push off the library mission. </p>
          <blockquote class="p-4">“We welcome and support all people in their enjoyment of

            read, to learn, to discover.” <br>- Chicago Public Library
          </blockquote>
          <p>So, library purpose seems to rotate around providing access to information,
            ideas, and knowledge. Although the main competitor of the library is any
            search engine, we focused on the companies that provide access to
            information and books, such as Amazon, Google, and Barnes&Nobles.</p>
          <p>We did a SWOT analysis and here are the areas where the competitors
            were coming shortly which would be a set of opportunities for the library:</p>
          <p><strong>Amazon</strong> - paid access <br><strong>Google</strong> - too much
            information, lack of credibility<br><strong>Barnes & Noble</strong> - paid access, limited to books</p>
          <p>What we saw is that there are so much information and so many resources
            offered that there is no way to tell what is real and what is not without
            additional searches.</p>

        <p>Given how abstract our challenge was we needed to talk to some experts to
          further narrow down the problems. As a team, we have spoken with a total of
          six librarians fulfilling different roles in different libraries. We have chosen
          libraries of different scale and locations to give us a better general picture.
          The problems that stood out and looked promising:</p>

        <h2 class="header" id="users">User research</h2>
        <p><strong>Why is it hard to reach young professionals?</strong></p>
        <p>We were onto something. We needed to understand what brings regular
          patrons (all ages) to the library, what do young professionals believe
          library offers and what challenges they encounter that library could
          potentially offer solutions for. </p>
        <p>We conducted a survey with 108 people filtering them by the
          frequency of the library usage and found the following:</p>
        <ul class="unstyled">
          <li>98% of users use the internet multiple times a day</li>
          <li>66% of users use the library a few times a year or never</li>
          <li>52% of users say the internet replaces the library</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of the survey subjects gave us a lead. This is how he
          explained the main reason why he didn’t use the library much:</p>
        <blockquote class="p-4">“There’s just too much to keep up with right now. It’s busy. Yeah”.<br> - Phillip

        <p>Interviewing 6 young professionals helped us to further narrow down problem areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Key problems</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lack of knowledge of library services</li>
          <li>Prefer to interact online</li>
          <li>Value convenience</li>
          <li>Inconvenient hours</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote class="p-4">“I think one of the things that keep me using the library is
          that you can really trust the information that is there. Or  I can compare
          it more objectively to the information I’m getting from other sources”.<br> - Michael, 33 years old

        <p>As a team, we decided to dig deeper into the whole credibility issue.
          Additional research helped us to define the following dissonance:</p>
        <ul class="unstyled">
          <li>87% of millennials think that libraries help find information that
            is trustworthy and reliable. <strong>- Belief</strong></li>
          <li>60% of Pew Research Center study participants, agreed that it is
            difficult to know whether information found online is trustworthy.
            <strong>- Need</strong></li>
          <li>66% of millennials interviewed by us prefer using the Internet
            and don’t use library services because they find them inconvenient.
          <br><strong>- Contradicting behavior</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why are library trust and usage is on a rise for millennials,
          and yet millennials we were talking too didn't use it?</strong></p>

          <p>The internet is a great resource for providing information quickly, but
            it’s not always credible. Young professionals need a flexible, reliable

        <p>At first, we thought that it should be mobile since most young professionals
          seem to spend the most time on their <strong>phone</strong>. But a person wants to have only
          that many apps, why compete with FB and google for the space on the user's phone.
          At least not until the product is established.<br><strong>Website</strong> Wasn’t hitting a
          spot either. Library already has a website and since we were challenged with
          digital product design and not service design we had to let go.<br>And that’s
          when we thought of <strong>extension</strong>. This would allow us to meet user right where they
          need us. They read something online, they doubt it and they can get help from the
          library right there.</p>
