      <h1 class="pb-5 mb-5 pt-5 mt-5">GDP Data Exercise</h1>
      <h2 class="header mb-5 mt-4">Process</h2>
      <p>The assignment reads: “Gross Domestic Product is the total value of all goods and services produced in a particular country’s economy in a given year and is widely
        <strong>used by economists to gauge the health of economies</strong>.”
        <br><br>I had a starting point to dig into understanding the potential users better: the (theoretical) users would most likely be trying to evaluate a country’s
        economic health. Given the scope of this project, I settled for some quick Google searching and narrowed down my potential users to economists and investors. I also solidified some use cases for what evaluating a country’s economic
        health might actually entail:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Quickly understand trends in GDP over time</li>
       <li>Focus on how GDP changed in a particular year</li>
       <li>Comparing the economies of 2+ countries</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
     <p>Given more time, I would have loved to conduct interviews with the target audience to truly understand their pain points and data interaction nuances. Although this wasn’t feasible, I felt like I had a pretty good starting point for
       designing a solution.

      <h2 class="header mb-5 mt-4">Solution</h2>
      <p>Looking at the data, the first thing I saw was GDP change over a period of time. To show data over time, I thought a line chart would be the best visualization. The viewer can analyze patterns without having to look too closely at
        specific numbers, and easily compare between countries.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>A line chart by itself is a relatively straightforward - my challenge was ideating on how a user would want to interact with data like this on various devices. I prototyped some features around the line chart that gives the user more
        power to interact with the data in a way that is useful to them.

      <h3>Zooming</h3>
      <p>Sixty years might be an overwhelming timeframe for a user to look at. It’s possible they only care about the last ten years and would like to see those years more clearly. Zooming allows the user to adjust the data as they see fit. This
        feature also makes the chart mobile friendly.

      <p>Country toggles let the user hide any information that is noisy to them. The current layout would
        quickly become crowded if more countries are added. So, if the project were extended beyond five countries,
        the design would need to be adjusted.

        Each card has a corresponding color line on the chart. The colored dot can be dragged which will change
