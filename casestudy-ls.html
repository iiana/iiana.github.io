            <p>Based out of Chicago, League Swype is a fantasy sports startup.
              League Swype’s founder, Darius, is on his way to create a fantasy
              sports hub based around payment collection and processing.
              Darius tasked us with making the process of signing up more user-friendly.
              <br><br>As a part of the team of three UX designers, I conducted research that 
              revealed useful insights that served as a foundation for further ideation.
              With the help of the mid-fidelity prototypes, we tested our solutions
              and prepared them to be implemented by a development team. </p>

            <h2 class="header">Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              To be a viable product in the space, League Swype needed to be sticker with users.
              It needed features that streamlined online fantasy sports beyond just inviting friends and doing money transfers.
              It also had a painful process for depositing money that needed to be addressed.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header">Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              To address the app’s lovability problem, we developed three new features to enhance its usefulness and entertainment value.
              To simplify the for the painful money deposits,
              we developed a more transparent workflow so that users would know what to expect.

        <h2 class="header">Background</h2>
        <p>
          League Swype is a tech startup that aims to make online fantasy sports management and payment easy,
          fun, and engaging. When we jumped on the project, the product was in beta.
          This version included functionality to create a league, invite friends, deposit money, and receive payouts.
          At this point, the product was essentially a digital wallet with some basic user management.

          <p>
            “I know it’s painful [the money deposits]”, said Darius, the founder of League Swype.
            “I am hoping you can figure out a way around this”. <br><br>Recently, the payment processor
            League Swype’s beta was built around - Skrill - got acquired by PaySafe. This resulted
            in Skrill’s rules around accepting payments to change, in a way that made the process
            really painful and unclear for users. Users need to deposit money into their League Swype
            account so that they can pay dues to fantasy sports leagues that they are a member of.

          <p>To deposit money on a League Swype account, new users had to do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a League Swype account.</li>
            <li>
              Sign up for Skrill. This includes providing a full SSN, pictures of the front/back of a driver’s
              license, and a few more really invasive and manual steps. Signing up for Skrill for the first time
              also requires an approval process that takes an inconsistent amount of time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deposit money into the Skrill account. This happens on Skrill’s website, not League Swype.
              Deposit fees range from one to six percent depending on the payment method.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer money from Skrill into the League Swype account. There is a four
              percent deposit fee applied in this process.

        <div class=" col-lg-12">
          <p>
            We needed to dig into whether or not using Skrill was a hard constraint.
            To answer this question, we looked into the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do competitors do?</li>
            <li>Could we use tokenization as a workaround?</li>
            <li>Could League Swype operate without an escrow account?</li>
            <li>Is there a payment processor that would allow credit and debit
              card payments for a fantasy sports application?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Within one week my team got to talk to two experts in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Anti-money_laundering">AML</a>
            (anti-money-laundering) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> (know-your-customer). We learned that
            although it is not legally considered gambling, the fantasy sports industry is under scrutiny and
            considered high risk by insurance companies. Without the insurance, it is difficult to get approved
            for a merchant account by most payment processors. We also looked into tokenization through Unikrn -
            a betting app for online gaming. Unikrn used tokens but also required a Skrill account, which led us to
            believe that tokenization would be another dead end. <br><br>Given time constraints and the level of available funding for League Swype, Darius and us made the call to move forward with the assumption that Skrill would be the payment processor backing the app.

          <p>
            To make a great product, just working around the constraint of Skrill wouldn’t be enough.
            We needed to understand the primary users of the app, their motives, and what features
            would best serve them. <br><br>Through user interviews, we identified two main user
            types and their needs. During these interviews, we also extracted a lot of useful
            information that we incorporated into new feature ideas.

          After some thought, we decided that we could make the biggest impact in the first half of
          the user journey. Playoffs and payouts take a while to actually get to because of how long
          fantasy sports seasons are. <strong>We needed to focus on getting users signed up by creating a great
          first impression and high initial value.</strong>

            the money deposit workflow. The other was to create features that hook users during the
            first half of their journey. We began ideating on potential solutions and validated them
            along the way through concept testing. We ended up throwing some ideas out and punting on
            others as potential future roadmap items. We came out with four implementations
            (one for depositing money, and three for product value) that we thought were feasible
            and would address the biggest concerns.

            identified a major usability issue. Users weren’t clear on how much money they had to spend to
            end up with the desired amount in their League Swype account. For example, to put $100 in a
            League Swype account, more than $100 needs to be deposited in Skrill due to transaction fees
            along the way.

          <p>
            An interesting part of this project was that I had zero prior knowledge of fantasy sports.
            I thought this would hinder my ability to contribute to the project, but I found that not
            knowing was actually useful. It helped me to get users talking more. I think people have
            a tendency to believe that certain things are just commonly known so they can skip them. Yet, because
            of my lack of knowledge, I ended up pushing users for more information, which led to a better understanding
            of their thoughts and preferences.
