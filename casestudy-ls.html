            <h2 class="header">Challenge</h2>
            <p>To be a viable product in the space, League Swype needed to be sticker with users.
              It needed features that streamlined online fantasy sports beyond just inviting friends and doing money transfers.
              It also had a painful process for depositing money that needed to be addressed.</p>
            <h2 class="header">Outcome</h2>
            <p>To address the app’s lovability problem, we developed three new features to enhance its usefulness and entertainment value.
              To simplify the for the painful money deposits,
              we developed a more transparent workflow so that users would know what to expect.

        <h2 class="header">Background</h2>
        <p>League Swype is a tech startup that aims to make online fantasy sports management and payment easy,
          fun, and engaging. When we jumped on the project, the product was in beta.
          This version included functionality to create a league, invite friends, deposit money, and receive payouts.
          At this point, the product was essentially a digital wallet with some basic user management.</p>

          <h2 class="header">Identifying Constraints</h2>
          <p>“I know it’s painful [the money deposits]”, said Darius, the founder of League Swype.
            “I am hoping you can figure out a way around this”. <br><br>Recently, the payment processor
            League Swype’s beta was built around - Skrill - got acquired by PaySafe. This resulted
            in Skrill’s rules around accepting payments to change, in a way that made the process
            really painful and unclear for users. Users need to deposit money into their League Swype
            account so that they can pay dues to fantasy sports leagues that they are a member of.

        <div class="col-md-9 mt-4">
          <p>To deposit money on a League Swype account, new users had to do the following:br</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a League Swype account.</li>
            <li>Sign up for Skrill. This includes providing a full SSN, pictures of the front/back of a driver’s
              license, and a few more really invasive and manual steps. Signing up for Skrill for the first time
              also requires an approval process that takes an inconsistent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Deposit money into the Skrill account. This happens on Skrill’s website, not League Swype.
              Deposit fees range from one to six percent depending on the payment method.</li>
            <li>Transfer money from Skrill into the League Swype account. There is a four
              percent deposit fee applied in this process.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>We needed to dig into whether or not using Skrill was a hard constraint.
            To answer this question, we looked into the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do competitors do?</li>
            <li>Could we use tokenization as a workaround?</li>
            <li>Could League Swype operate without an escrow account?</li>
            <li>Is there a payment processor that would allow credit and debit
              card payments for a fantasy sports application?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Within one week my team got to talk to two experts in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Anti-money_laundering">AML</a>
            (anti-money-laundering)and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> (know-your-customer). We learned that
            although it is not legally considered gambling, the fantasy sports industry is under scrutiny and
            considered high risk by insurance companies. Without the insurance, it is difficult to get approved
            for a merchant account by most payment processors. We also looked into tokenization through Unikrn -
            a betting app for online gaming. Unikrn used tokens but also required a Skrill account, which led us to
            believe that tokenization would be another dead end. <br><br>Given time constraints and the level of available funding for League Swype, Darius and us made the call to move forward with the assumption that Skrill would be the payment processor backing the app.
