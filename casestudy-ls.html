            League Swype is a tech startup that aims to make online fantasy sports management and payment easy,
            fun, and engaging. When we jumped on the project, the product was in beta.
            This version included functionality to create a league, invite friends, deposit money, and receive payouts.
            At this point, the product was essentially a digital wallet with some basic user management.

            “I know it’s painful [the money deposits]”, said Darius, the founder of League Swype.
            “I am hoping you can figure out a way around this”. <br><br>Recently, the payment processor
            League Swype’s beta was built around - Skrill - got acquired by PaySafe. This resulted
            in Skrill’s rules around accepting payments to change, in a way that made the process
            really painful and unclear for users. Users need to deposit money into their League Swype
            account so that they can pay dues to fantasy sports leagues that they are a member of.

            <li>
              Sign up for Skrill. This includes providing a full SSN, pictures of the front/back of a driver’s
              license, and a few more really invasive and manual steps. Signing up for Skrill for the first time
              also requires an approval process that takes an inconsistent amount of time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deposit money into the Skrill account. This happens on Skrill’s website, not League Swype.
              Deposit fees range from one to six percent depending on the payment method.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer money from Skrill into the League Swype account. There is a four
              percent deposit fee applied in this process.

            We needed to dig into whether or not using Skrill was a hard constraint.
            To answer this question, we looked into the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do competitors do?</li>
            <li>Could we use tokenization as a workaround?</li>
            <li>Could League Swype operate without an escrow account?</li>
            <li>Is there a payment processor that would allow credit and debit
              card payments for a fantasy sports application?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Within one week my team got to talk to two experts in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Anti-money_laundering">AML</a>
            (anti-money-laundering) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a> (know-your-customer). We learned that
            although it is not legally considered gambling, the fantasy sports industry is under scrutiny and
            considered high risk by insurance companies. Without the insurance, it is difficult to get approved
            for a merchant account by most payment processors. We also looked into tokenization through Unikrn -
            a betting app for online gaming. Unikrn used tokens but also required a Skrill account, which led us to
            believe that tokenization would be another dead end. <br><br>Given time constraints and the level of available funding for League Swype, Darius and us made the call to move forward with the assumption that Skrill would be the payment processor backing the app.

            To make a great product, just working around the constraint of Skrill wouldn’t be enough.
            We needed to understand the primary users of the app, their motives, and what features
            would best serve them. <br><br>Through user interviews, we identified two main user
            types and their needs. During these interviews, we also extracted a lot of useful
            information that we incorporated into new feature ideas.

        <div class="col-md-9 offset-md-1">
          <p>Our research included interviewing a total of eight users.  Five of them were commissioners ages 21-41 with 6-20 years of experience of playing 1-12 leagues per season. Our research (coming up with interview questions, interviewing itself, and synthesizing the data) was a team effort. However, there was one piece of testing that I think is especially noteworthy.
            <br><br>At the very beginning of the research phase, we needed a better understanding of user priorities to validate the need for the main functionality of the app. The CEO originally validated his product idea by essentially asking "would you like this perfectly working tool?", which felt one-sided. Just because test subjects say they would like a fantastic tool doesn't mean that they would actually pay for it. We needed to understand what users saw as something worth paying for.
            <br><br>Racing games have a concept that no car you select can be perfect. One car might be faster but be harder to turn. One might be easy to turn but less durable. We wanted to mimic this core idea to see how users would prioritize potential value. We gave each interviewee twenty chips and asked them to allocate them between the three following categories:
            <br><br>1. Payout timeframe - How long do they need to wait to get their winnings?
            <br>2. League Pool Transparency - knowing who paid, how much is in the pool, etc.
            <br>3. Payout Fee - how much are you willing to pay for the above two?
            <br><br><strong>Our results indicated that people cared enough about #1 and #2 to pay, and the transparency was the most important aspect of the three.</strong></p>

            After some thought, we decided that we could make the biggest impact in the first half of
            the user journey. Playoffs and payouts take a while to actually get to because of how long
            fantasy sports seasons are. <strong>We needed to focus on getting users signed up by creating a great
            first impression and high initial value.</strong>

          At this point, we had determined our two high-level goals. One was to smoothen
          the money deposit workflow. The other was to create features that hook users during the
          first half of their journey. We began ideating on potential solutions and validated them
          along the way through concept testing. We ended up throwing some ideas out and punting on
          others as potential future roadmap items. We came out with four implementations
          (one for depositing money, and three for product value) that we thought were feasible
          and would address the biggest concerns.

              When we tested the current workflow with Skrill, we learned that users were confused by vague
              fee descriptions and the fact that there are fees on both League Swype and Skrill. We also
              identified a major usability issue. Users weren’t clear on how much money they had to spend to
              end up with the desired amount in their League Swype account. For example, to put $100 in a
              League Swype account, more than $100 needs to be deposited in Skrill due to transaction fees
              along the way.

                To address these issues, we developed a fee calculator that made it clear

                end up within their League Swype account.

                We wanted to make the app really useful for commissioners so that they’d be enticed to
                host their leagues on League Swype. We came out with three new features focused around the
                commissioner’s pain points.

              With this reminder feature, commissioners can select owners that haven’t paid their dues
              yet and send a group reminder. They can also choose the tone of the message they want, and
              the app will generate a fun message that they can then customize. Users mentioning their joy
              for trash talking during interviews influenced the light-heartedness of this feature.

              let a commissioner start a league with preset rules for payout structure.

              League analytics offer an advanced overview of everything that is happening in the league.
              Both commissioners and owners get to see information about other league members. This
              includes fun performance stats that could be gathered from a fantasy provider’s data.

            We handed off all of the necessary documentation for these features so that the development team could
            actually go and build them. We also left Darius with some notes on things that needed further investigation.
            We spent most of our energy focusing on the first half of the commissioner’s journey. If we had more time,
            we would have dove into:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding the owner’s journey better and developing features that focus on the owner’s use cases</li>
            <li>Other opportunities to extract from the relationship between owners and commissioners</li>
            <li>Digging into peer-to-peer payments area</li>
            <li>Technical constraints for getting data out of fantasy providers</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            An interesting part of this project was that I had zero prior knowledge of fantasy sports.
            I thought this would hinder my ability to contribute to the project, but I found that not
            knowing was actually useful. It helped me to get users talking more. I think people have
            a tendency to believe that certain things are just commonly known so they can skip them. Yet, because
            of my lack of knowledge, I ended up pushing users for more information, which led to a better understanding
            of their thoughts and preferences.
