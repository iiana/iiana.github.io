        <p>To be a viable product in the space, League Swype needed to be sticker with users.
          It needed features that streamlined online fantasy sports beyond just inviting friends and doing money transfers.
          It also had a painful process for depositing money that needed to be addressed.</p>
        <h2 class="header">Outcome</h2>
        <p>To address the appâ€™s lovability problem, we developed three new features to enhance its usefulness and entertainment value.
          To simplify the for the painful money deposits,
          we developed a more transparent workflow so that users would know what to expect.

        <p>League Swype is a tech startup that aims to make online fantasy sports management and payment easy,
          fun, and engaging. When we jumped on the project, the product was in beta.
          This version included functionality to create a league, invite friends, deposit money, and receive payouts.
          At this point, the product was essentially a digital wallet with some basic user management.</p>
