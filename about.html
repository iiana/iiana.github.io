          <p class="pt-5"><strong>Hi, I’m Iana. A UX designer based in Boulder, CO.
            I’ve been doing art/design related things for the last five years.</strong> I am currently looking to join a team of creative, smart people that I can grow with. I consider myself a lifelong learner and love being challenged with new ideas and opportunities.<br><br>
            I believe that children have qualities that would make them great UX designers (and humans in general): curiosity, the ability to enjoy simple things, and imagination untainted by preconceptions. I try my best to keep my inner child alive.<br><br>
            My journey has brought me to live across 3 countries and 14 cities. This variety has taught me that there are so many perspectives and ways of life. My takeaway has been that nobody is always right, and everybody is right in their own way.<br><br>
            I enjoy a good book and a cup of tea. I love nature and don’t care about fonts as long as they are easy to read and the message is clear. Let me know if that cup of tea sounds good to you:
