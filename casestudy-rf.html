              My team of three designers was challenged to create a digital product
              to help the library strengthen its reach. The assignment was vague (again, this was a study project) - we were
              essentially told to just brainstorm on how libraries could attract more visitors in the digital age.

              us to the creation of a browser extension: ResourceFull. The extension helps our users to find

              So, a library's main purpose is to provide access to information,
              ideas, and knowledge. We thought that search engines and book stores
              fit this concept, so we did a SWOT analysis using Google, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble.
              The competitors' weaknesses are either paid access or lack of curation of materials offered.

            Lots of our key findings felt like things that were out of our reach (making budget changes, for example),
            but Gina's comment stood out to us. It was something we could definitely relate to, and felt
            like a gap that could be bridged. To understand why young professionals aren't utilizing their
            local libraries, we conducted a survey with 108 people (variety of ages), and interviewed 6 (young professionals). We didn't just
            target people who don't use library resources; we also wanted to know what people that
            <strong>were</strong> using their libraries found useful.

          <p><strong>Interview findings</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>There was lack of knowledge about what a library can offer. Interviewees believed that the library is merely

            We were trying to attract new visitors to the library. Young professionals already read a ton of blogs, articles, etc in their browser.
